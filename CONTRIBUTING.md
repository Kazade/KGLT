# How to Contribute

Third-party contributions are the best way to accelerate Simulant development. 
Simulant cannot be the game engine we want it to be without the help of its community.

There are many ways you can contribute, it's not all about writing code!

 - You can report issues and request features.
 - You can improve the Simulant documentation.
 - You can test Simulant and report any things that hinder you.
 - And of course, you can submit code changes.
 
**The one important thing to note is that by submitting code or documentation changes you agree to license
those changes under both the LGPL 3.0 license and the MIT license.**

To get started contributing with Simulant, you'll need the following:

 - A GitLab account. This will allow you to create feature requests and report issues, as well as submit "merge requests".
 - Knowledge of Git. Git is the version control system that we use to track changes. There are lots of online tutorials to get you up and running.
 - A Discord account. This is optional, but if you join out Discord server you can get help and advice about contributing.
 
## Updating the documentation

All of the documentation is stored in the `documentation` folder and is written in Markdown format.

To contribute by adding or improving the documentation, please "fork" the Simulant GitLab repository under your own account. You can make edits to the documentation
there in the online editor, or you can use Git to clone your fork and make changes locally. Once you have made your changes and pushed them to your
GitLab fork, then submit a Merge Request for review.
