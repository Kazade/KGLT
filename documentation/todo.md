KGLT is a one-man project, and it is already way too large for that! Lots of areas of 
the engine are flakey, untested, or just downright badly thought out!

My aim is that, if I keep hacking as and when I can, eventually it will be a useful,
easy to use game engine. Until then, here are some of the things that need doing:

 - Shadows
 - Lighting (half-complete)
 - Reflections
 - Render to texture (e.g. the texture parameter to add_pipeline)
 - Making Octree culling actually work
 - Support for (at least) MD3, MD5 and MS3D models
 - Unit tests... lots of unit tests
 - Special effects (fog, projective textures etc.)
 - Animated, dynamic sky spheres/weather systems
 - Culling improvments, testing of the dynamic octree partitioner
 - Funky anti-aliasing
 - Steam controller compatibility 
 - General game controller improvements using SDL 2 features
 - Better world geometry subdivision/culling
 - Better debugging tools
 - Memory pooling
