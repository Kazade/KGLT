# Environment Variables

These variables can be set at runtime (before init) to influence the behaviour of the engine.

 - `SIMULANT_RENDERER` - `[gl1x|gl2x]` This allows you to switch to another renderer. On Dreamcast
   only gl1x is available. This variable is useful for developing for Dreamcast compatibility.
 - `SIMULANT_PROFILE` - `[1]` Passing this will disable frame limiting and print engine profile stats on shutdown.
