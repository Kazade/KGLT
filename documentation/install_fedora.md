# Fedora (Linux) Installation

The following installation process is probably very similar for other Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, Debian etc.) the main difference should
only be the packages which must be installed.

# Prerequisites

First you need `pip` available, this may be installed already but if not run:

```
sudo dnf install python-pip
```

# Installation 

Next, you need to install the `simulant-tools` pip package globally:

```
sudo pip install simulant-tools
```

One installation is complete, you will have access to the `simulant` command.
